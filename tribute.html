     <h1>TRIBUTE TO OUR PARENTS</h1>
<br> 
<br>
  <p>We want to take a moment to remind you of the incredible impact you have on our lives. For our mother who carried us for 9 months and gave birth and for our father who worked hard to support our mother throughout her pregnancy, a very warm thank you. Being a parent was never been an easy role to portray. Since the day we came in your lives we know how happy both of you are. We thank you for your dedication, love, and support that has crucial role in shaping our future. 
<br> 
<br>
You are our role models, your actions and words have a significant impact on our development. You are our best cheerleaders in our brightest and darkest days. Your encouragement helps us grow into confident, independent, and successful individuals. 
<br> 
<br>
In the world full of negativity you are our sanctuary. Parenting is not always easy, and there will be ups and downs along the way. But, with patience, perseverance, and love, you can overcome any challenge that comes your way.
<br> 
<br>
So, keep doing what you are doing, and never underestimate the importance of your role as a parent. You are also the one who was shaping the future of us, and that is truly an incredible responsibility and privilege.
<br> 
<br>
Always believe in yourself and also believe in us, and never lose hope. Together, we can achieve anything you set your minds to.
<br> 
<br>
With love and admiration,<br> 
Your children
