        <h1>JENFIEL TOMARONG</h1>
        <p>
          An aspiring 18-years old BSIT student from Cordova Public College.
          Graduated from Marigondon National High School under TVL (dressmaking
          and tailoring) strand at Marigondon Lapu-Lapu City. Currently living at
          Suba-Masulog Basak Lapu-Lapu City. I also wished to learn more about
          technology and how they works since I was inspired in some movies about
          people who used technology not only for personal use and some editing
          clips in which they make use of some apps to designs in a dress.
